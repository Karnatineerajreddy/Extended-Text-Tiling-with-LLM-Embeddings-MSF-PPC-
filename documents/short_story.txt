The sun had just begun to sink behind the distant tree line when Mia arrived at the old cabin she had not visited since childhood, and although years had passed and countless memories had faded, the quiet stillness of the place triggered a flood of emotions that felt both distant and strangely familiar, as if the past were gently calling her back.
